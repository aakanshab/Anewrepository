About Confluence

Create, collaborate, and organize all your work in one place. Confluence is a team workspace where knowledge and collaboration meet. Dynamic pages give your team a place to create, capture, and collaborate on any project or idea. Spaces help your team structure, organize, and share work, so every team member has visibility into institutional knowledge and access to the information they need to do their best work.

Confluence is for teams of any size and type, from those with mission-critical, high-stakes projects that need rigor behind their practices, to those that are looking for a space to build team culture and engage with one another in a more open and authentic way.

Equipped with Confluence, your team 

can make quick decisions, 

gain alignment, and 

accomplish more together.
